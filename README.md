Welcome to my portfolio website! This website showcases responsive design, ensuring an optimal viewing experience.

Deployed on https://extraterra1.github.io/Odin-Portfolio/

## Project Description

For my final HTML/CSS project, I created a responsive portfolio site. A well-designed portfolio is essential for sharing your work and applying for jobs. In this project, I took my time to ensure that the site looks great on full desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

## Project Instructions

### Step 1: Set up and planning

- Set up HTML and CSS files with simple dummy content to verify correct linkage.
- Create a Git repository.
- Download design files for full desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
- Plan the layout for the HTML document.

### Step 2: Gather assets

- Find a placeholder image for the portrait.
- Choose fonts (Basico, Violety Dreams and LT Museum from CDNFonts).
- Add social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter) with icons from https://materialdesignicons.com/
- Include other icons (phone, email, external link) using SVGs from https://materialdesignicons.com/
